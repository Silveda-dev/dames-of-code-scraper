Dames of Code is a web-app designed to share the stories of early women in technology. Using BeautifulSoup, it scrapes and formats content from their Wikipedia profiles and then, using Flask, renders this information in a HTML template. All of the women featured in DoC were sourced from the book _Broad Band_ by Claire L. Evans.
